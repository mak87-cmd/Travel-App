# Travel App

## Description
This is the fourth project in the Udacity front end development course. The purpose of the project is to build an asynchronous travel app that takes user input and uses the Geonames API, Pixabay API and Weatherbit API to dynamically update the UI to provide the user the current temperature of the city they're traveling to on the date they enter for their trip. If the travel date is a week or less from the user's input, the the current temperature is given along with a picture of the city they're traveling to. If the travel date is over a week or more, the weather forecast for that city is given along with the city they're traveling to. The extended function added to the project is to show the length of the trip the user entered.
